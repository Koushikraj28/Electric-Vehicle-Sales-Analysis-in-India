## Final Summary: Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis in India

In this project, I analyzed Electric Vehicle (EV) sales data across Indian states to uncover trends and insights from 2014 to 2024.

## What I Did:
- Cleaned and explored a real-world dataset containing 96,000+ entries.
- Performed visual analysis on:
  - State-wise and year-wise EV sales
  - Most sold vehicle types and categories
  - Monthly and category-wise sales trends
- Created clean and meaningful visualizations using `seaborn` & `matplotlib`.

## Key Insights:
- **Uttar Pradesh** & **Maharashtra** lead in total EV sales.
- **2-Wheelers** & **3-Wheelers** dominate the EV market.
- **Sales peak during festive season months (Octâ€“Dec)**.
- EV adoption has **rapidly grown** post-2021.

## Tech Stack:
- Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## Final Thoughts:
This project helped me:
- Strengthen my EDA and visualization skills
- Understand EV market trends in India
- Practice beginner-friendly data storytelling
